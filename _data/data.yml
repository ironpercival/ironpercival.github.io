    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Long story short, my specialty is enterprise software development, building agile and lean teams, and teaching students both subjects. For development part I stick to C#/.NET and prefer to work with modern cloud approaches and architectures (Azure, going serverless, lightweight DDD etc). I take special care about rigorous domain analysis, solution architecture, and software design (OOAD). These are my strongest traits, while I am not an expert in advanced low-level implementation topics, .NET internals etc. Also, I am passionate about organizing teamwork in lean fashion and setting up development and delivery process. Finally, I share my knowledge and experience with students and give two courses at university.
